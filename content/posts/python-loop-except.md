Something that is not common knowledge is the fact that Python for loop can have an `else` clause:

```python
def check(target, iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if element == target:
            print("Jup, target is in container.")
            break
    else:
        print("Seems like target is not in container.")

check("s", "a string")
# >>> Jup, target is in container.
check("e", "a string")
# >>> Seems like target is not in container.
```

An else clause is executed when a for loop ends normally without break being called.
Internally, Python will trigger a `StopIteration` when this happens.

Such an else clause may save you some lines of codes when itterating in the middle of a complex function by getting rid of assignment checks or boolean flags.
However, in the simplified example above using `return` instead of `break` and `else` would most likely produce code that is more robust and easier to comprehend as `for/else` is not a well-known construct.
